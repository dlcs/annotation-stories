# annotation-stories

Issues repo to gather user stores for Elucidate extensions, especially around authenticated flows.

The W3C Anno Protocol has no facility for auth; this repository gathers stories for use of annotations from clients such as Mirador, Digrati Annotation studio and other clients, with an IIIF focus. This means thinking about the correspondence of containers to Annotation Collections, Annotation Pages in the context of particular IIIF resources such as Canvases and Ranges.
